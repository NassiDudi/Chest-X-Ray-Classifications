## Project Overview
This project aims to classify chest X-ray images to detect pneumonia by leveraging deep learning techniques. Four different models were implemented and compared to evaluate their performance in this medical image classification task.
1. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): A custom CNN model designed specifically for this task.
2. Pretrained ResNet50: Another transfer learning model utilizing the ResNet50 architecture to leverage its deep feature extraction capabilities.
3. Pretrained VGG16: A transfer learning model based on the VGG16 architecture, known for its simplicity and effectiveness in image classification tasks.
4. Vision Transformer (ViT): A transformer-based architecture adapted for image classification, leveraging self-attention mechanisms to capture global image features.   
The models were evaluated on their ability to classify chest X-ray images into normal and pneumonia categories, and the results were compared to identify the best-performing approach.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of chest X-ray images categorized into two classes:

In this project, data augmentation techniques were applied to improve model generalization, prevent overfitting, and simulate real-world image variations. 
The following augmentation strategies were implemented:

|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Random Affine**          | Applies random rotations and translations up to 15° and 10% translation.        |
| **Random Resized Crop**    | Randomly crops and resizes images with a scale of (0.8, 1.0). |
| **RandomHorizontalFlip**   | Randomly flips images horizontally with a probability of 0.5.               |
| **RandomRotation**         | Rotates images randomly up to 15°.                |

## Code Breakdown
### 1. Data Augmentation
Before training the model, the dataset is augmented and divided to dataloades.
### 2. Defining Modles
- ComplexCNNModel: The model is a CNN with three convolutional layers, followed by max-pooling, dropout, and fully connected layers for binary classification. The output layer uses a sigmoid activation to produce a probability score between 0 and 1.
- Pre-Trained Models: ResNet50, VGG16 and ViT
### 3. Training, Validation, and Testing
Each model (ComplexCNN, ResNet, VGG, ViT) is trained using the training dataset, followed by validation on the validation dataset to assess its performance. After training and validation, the model is tested on a separate test dataset to evaluate its accuracy and performance.
### 4. Evaluation
The final results are presented with the confusion matrix, training and validation losses graph and accuracy score of each model.
### 5. Fine-Tuning the ResNet Model
The ResNet model is fine-tuned by experimenting with different batch sizes (16, 32, 64) and learning rates (0.001, 0.0001, 0.01). The model is trained for 3 epochs with the AdamW optimizer and a learning rate scheduler. After each epoch, training and validation losses, as well as accuracy, are tracked. The model is then evaluated on a test set, and the best configuration (based on test accuracy) is saved along with the model's details for further analysis.

## Visualization
### Visual Outputs:

2. **Training Metrics**: Loss and accuracy curves over epochs on the validation set.
3. **Confusion Matrix**: A heatmap showing the confusion matrix to visualize the performance of the model in terms of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.

## Summary
In this project, I aimed to solve an important image classification task by leveraging four powerful models: CNN, ResNet, VGG, and ViT (Vision Transformer). These models were selected based on their proven effectiveness in computer vision tasks. Each model was carefully trained, evaluated, and compared to assess their performance in the given task.
To ensure that the most accurate model was chosen, the performance of all four models was measured across key metrics, including test accuracy, loss, and validation performance. After evaluating the models, I performed fine-tuning on the best-performing models to enhance their accuracy further. Fine-tuning involved adjusting hyperparameters, such as batch size and learning rate, as well as utilizing data augmentation techniques to improve model generalization and robustness.
Fine-Tuning ResNet Model achieved the best performance(94% Test Accuracy), demonstrating the effectiveness of fine-tuning for optimizing the model.
Through this process, I successfully utilized multiple state-of-the-art models to address a challenging image classification problem, comparing their strengths and weaknesses.
